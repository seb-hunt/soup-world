        <p class = "recipeDesc">Avgolemono is a traditional Greek soup that has been enjoyed for centuries. The word "Avgolemono" literally means "egg-lemon" in Greek, which perfectly describes the main ingredients used to create this delicious soup. The origins of this soup are not entirely clear, but it is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean region and was passed down from generation to generation. It's not just a soup, but a comfort food that has been shared with family and friends during special occasions or as a hearty meal on a cold day. The tangy and creamy flavors of the soup make it a popular choice not only in Greece but all over the world.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the Arborio rice and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the rice until tender, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest until light and frothy.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk a ladleful of the hot chicken broth into the egg mixture to temper it, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.</li>
                <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pot with the remaining chicken broth and rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the soup thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes. Do not let the soup come to a boil or the eggs will curdle.</li>
                <li>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the chopped parsley.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the soup.</li>
                <li>Serve the Avgolemono hot and enjoy!</li>
