        <p class = "recipeDesc">Mulukhiyah is a traditional dish enjoyed in many Middle Eastern and African countries. The dish gets its name from the main ingredient, a leafy green vegetable known as Jute Mallow. The leaves are finely chopped and then cooked in a flavorful broth, resulting in a thick and satisfying soup. Mulukhiyah has a long history and has been enjoyed by people in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and many other countries for centuries. It's often served with rice or bread and is a staple food during special occasions and holidays. The origins of Mulukhiyah can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where it was considered a food fit for royalty. Today, it's still beloved by many and is considered a symbol of hospitality and generosity.</p>

            <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>If using fresh Mulukhiyah, wash and finely chop the leaves. If using frozen, thaw the leaves and set aside.</li>
              <li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute.</li>
              <li>Add the boneless chicken to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. If not using chicken, skip this step.</li>
              <li>Add the Mulukhiyah leaves to the pot along with the chicken or vegetable broth. Stir to combine.</li>
              <li>Add the ground coriander, cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt to taste. Stir to combine.</li>
              <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the Mulukhiyah leaves are fully cooked and tender.</li>
              <li>Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until it reaches a smooth consistency. If you don't have an immersion blender, carefully transfer the soup to a blender and blend until smooth, then return to the pot.</li>
              <li>Adjust the seasoning as needed, then serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
            </ol>
