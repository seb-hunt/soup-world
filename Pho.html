        <p class = "recipeDesc">Pho is a delicious and aromatic noodle soup that originated in Vietnam in the early 20th century. It is said that the dish was created by Vietnamese street vendors who combined French and Vietnamese culinary influences to make a unique and flavorful soup. Pho is typically made with a beef or chicken broth that is simmered for hours with a variety of spices and aromatics such as star anise, cinnamon, and ginger. The broth is then served with rice noodles, thinly sliced meat, and fresh herbs such as cilantro and Thai basil. Pho is a staple dish in Vietnamese cuisine and has become popular all around the world for its hearty and comforting flavors. Whether you're enjoying a bowl in a busy street stall in Vietnam or at your favorite local restaurant, pho is sure to warm your heart and satisfy your taste buds!</p>
