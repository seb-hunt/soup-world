                <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Add the butter to the pot and let it melt. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>

                <li>Reduce heat to low and let simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the drained clams and heavy cream to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 5 minutes until heated through.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Garnish with the reserved crispy bacon and chopped parsley or chives, if desired.</li>
