        <p class = "recipeDesc">Pozole is a delicious and hearty soup that originated in Mexico and has been warming the hearts (and stomachs) of people for centuries. It's made with hominy, which are corn kernels that have been treated with an alkaline solution to remove the hull and soften the kernels, giving it a unique texture and flavor. The broth is usually made with pork or chicken and is seasoned with a blend of spices that varies from region to region. It's traditionally served with garnishes such as shredded lettuce, radishes, avocado, and lime juice. Pozole is a staple dish in many Mexican households and is enjoyed at celebrations, family gatherings, or simply on a cold day when you need something comforting to warm you up.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Preheat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil and brown the pork in batches until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes per batch. Remove from the pot and set aside.</li>
              <li>Add the onions and garlic to the pot and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Add the cumin, oregano, bay leaves, and chiles to the pot and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
              <li>Add the chicken broth and hominy to the pot, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>Remove the chiles and bay leaves from the pot and discard. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth.</li>
              <li>Add the browned pork to the pot and let simmer for another 30 minutes until the pork is tender.</li>
              <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
