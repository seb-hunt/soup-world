        <p class = "recipeDesc">Seolleongtang is a delicious and comforting soup that has been a staple in Korean cuisine for centuries. It's made with beef bones that are simmered for hours until the broth becomes milky-white and rich in flavor. Legend has it that the soup was first created by Korean farmers who wanted to make the most of every part of the cow. They would boil the bones and scraps of meat for hours until they had a nourishing and hearty soup that would keep them going all day. Today, Seolleongtang is enjoyed all over Korea and is especially popular during the cold winter months. It's often served with rice, kimchi, and other side dishes, making it a truly satisfying and filling meal.</p>
