        <p class = "recipeDesc">Gumbo is a dish that's as unique and vibrant as the city it hails from, New Orleans! This savory and hearty stew is a melting pot of cultures and flavors, just like the Big Easy itself. Its origins can be traced back to West Africa, where okra was commonly used in stews. When African slaves were brought to America, they brought their culinary traditions with them, and gumbo was born. Over the years, the dish evolved to incorporate ingredients like the "holy trinity" of onions, peppers, and celery, as well as seafood, chicken, and sausage. It's a dish that's meant to be shared and enjoyed with friends and family, with each pot boasting its own unique blend of spices and ingredients. So if you're looking for a taste of New Orleans, grab a bowl of gumbo, crank up some jazz music, and laissez les bon temps rouler!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk continuously until it turns a deep brown color, about 20-25 minutes. This is the roux, the base of the gumbo.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion, green bell pepper, and celery to the pot, and stir to combine. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are softened.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic, sliced andouille sausage, and chicken pieces to the pot, and stir to combine. Cook for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is browned.</li>
                <li>Add the can of diced tomatoes, chicken broth, bay leaf, dried thyme, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 30-40 minutes until the flavors have melded together.</li>
                <li>Add the peeled and deveined shrimp and sliced okra to the pot, and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes until the shrimp are pink and cooked through.</li>
                <li>Serve the gumbo hot over cooked white rice, and garnish with chopped fresh parsley or green onions, if desired.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your delicious bowl of gumbo!</li>
